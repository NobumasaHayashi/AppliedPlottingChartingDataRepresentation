# AppliedPlottingChartingDataRepresentation
This repository is for the final project of the course 'Applied Plotting, Charting, and Data Representation in Python' by University of Michigan on Coursera.

The project title is 'Becoming an Independent Data Scinetist'.

The data sets that I chose are about the results of Canadian ice hockey teams in NHL North division. The data sets are downloaded from [hockyDB.com](https://www.hockeydb.com/). 

My research question is that 'How have the win ratio for the Canadian ice hockey teams in NHL North division (i.e. Vancouver Canucks, Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, Winnipeg Jets, Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, and Ottawa Senetors) change over the last ten years?' Since I currently live in Vancouver, I'm interested in Vancouver Canucks, especially. 

This repository has all the data that I used in the analysis.
