# AppliedPlottingChartingDataRepresentation
This repository is for the final project of the course 'Applied Plotting, Charting, and Data Representation in Python' by University of Michigan on Coursera.

The project title is 'Becoming an Independent Data Scinetist'.

The data sets that I chose are about the results of Canadian ice hockey teams in NHL North division.
The data sets are downloaded from [hockyDB.com](https://www.hockeydb.com/).
